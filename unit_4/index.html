			<p>"5 STARS!!!! New Leaf Design did an amazing job painting our shutters! Were very prompt, fair price, professional and even stayed a little longer to finish the job completely on day 1! We definitely plan on using these guys for all our home improvement needs in the future. Thanks again Jesse!"</p>

			<p>"Jesse painted our nursery and did some touch up in another bedroom. He did a beautiful job with the pink satin paint I chose & the lines were crisp between that pink and the bright white trim and ceilings. He was professional, kind, efficient, and fairly priced! We highly recommend him for all of your painting needs and more!"</p>
